    """Handles multiple players and serves their audio to pyBinSim.

    All methods for getting or setting player data will raise an exception if
    the player name is unknown.

    Thread Safety
    -------------
    All public methods are thread-safe with the exception of `get_block` and
    `get_zeros`, which both should only be called from one thread. 

    The `_players` dict has to be iterated in `get_block` to get the audio from
    all players, hence the dict keys must not be modified while `get_block` is
    running. To ensure this, `_players_lock` must be acquired before all
    insertions/removals. Keep locked code as short as possible to avoid blocking
    the audio thread. 

    The data from the player entries is used multiple times during
    add_at_start_channel. To ensure consistency during such non-atomic read
    operations, each entry has its own lock that must be acquired before it can
    be modified or read non-atomically. The contained Player can be modified
    without acquiring this lock.
